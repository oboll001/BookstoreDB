This is a project that I worked on in Fall of 2019 for my database management class. It was a fun project that I look back upon with delight.
I learned a lot about how to work with SQL, and it was my first time working with HTML and CSS. We used a XAMPP server to build the database.
My teammates and I had to develop then work with a relational diagram to establish a working understanding of the database.
